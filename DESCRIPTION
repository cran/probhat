Description: Mass functions, density functions, distribution functions and quantile functions via continuous kernel smoothing, and to a lesser extent, discrete kernel smoothing. Also, supports categorical distributions and smooth empirical-like distributions. There are univariate, multivariate and conditional distributions, including multivariate-conditional distributions and conditional distributions with mixed input types, along with functions for plotting univariate, bivariate and trivariate distributions. Conditional categorical distributions with mixed input types can be used for statistical classification purposes. And there are extensions for computing multivariate probabilities, multivariate random numbers, moment-based statistics, robust-based statistics and mode estimates.
